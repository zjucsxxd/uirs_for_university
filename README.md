Task: write a programm which will recognize rc cars with marker on the top, and tanslate car's coordinates by socket. To implement it I have chosen Qt framework + opencv lib.
! Have a trouble to convert black-white Mat to Qimage because Qimage doesnt have single-channel case, only mono and 3 channel, stange..
To run this code you need Qt x64 becouse opencv 3 and futher has only x64 release.
